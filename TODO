- fetch data from correct app store i.e. UK for now (X-Apple-Store-Front: 143444,5)
- sort out apps without artist & genre so we can switch validation on
- add validation for presence of description
- capture version data from Info.plist with ipa file?
- sort out layout on app page when no pagination element

- write some acceptance tests
- think about most common story for using website
  - see my apps
  - find my friends
  - see apps that my friends have installed (and I don't?)
- should probably just mark installs as removed rather than actually destroy them
- git ignore config.yml
- use explicit path for config.yml
- possibly extract sync logic into Synchronizer class or similar
- investigate using Tempfile for unzipping
- investigate using Ruby libs instead of command line for unzip and plutil
- add authentication
- add attributes to apps
  - icon
  - version (use for uniqueness?)
  - install link (app store)
- use better identifier for apps instead of name
- write alternative clients for other app types
  - OSX desktop apps
  - Firefox plugins
- vendorize/unpack required libs/gems
- c.f. Delicious Library i.e. display software titles on a virtual shelf?
