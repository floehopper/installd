- think about most common story for using website e.g. see apps that my friends have installed (and I don't?)
- git ignore config.yml
- use explicit path for config.yml
- possibly extract sync logic into Synchronizer class or similar
- investigate using Tempfile for unzipping
- investigate using Ruby libs instead of command line for unzip and plutil
- add authentication
- add attributes to apps (including version)
- use better identifier for apps instead of name
- write alternative clients for other app types
- vendorize/unpack required libs/gems
